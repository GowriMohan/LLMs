      "2. **Hugging Face**: Hugging Face provides a wide range of language models, including several GPT-2 and GPT-3 variants that can be used for free. You can run these models in your own environment or through their website, depending on the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **EleutherAI's GPT-Neo and GPT-J**: EleutherAI has released open-source alternatives to GPT-3, like GPT-Neo and GPT-J, which are available for free. You can access them through Hugging Face’s model hub or run them locally.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Google's T5 and BERT**: While not strictly GPT models, Google offers various transformer models, including T5 and BERT, which can be used with frameworks like Hugging Face for free.\n",

      "5. **Cohere**: Cohere also offers a free tier for their language models, which can be used for various natural language processing tasks.\n",
