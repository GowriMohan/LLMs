The curriculum was well-structured, covering everything from basic neural networks to advanced frameworks and architectures.  One of the highlights was the transformer architecture, which was covered in remarkable depth with absolute clarity—no confusion, just a seamless understanding of self-attention, positional encoding, and how these models scale. And the way Keerti delivered it leaves a lasting impact—truly unmatched and unforgettable! Beyond the structured content, they also stretched beyond to cover the absolute latest - DeepSeek. Concepts that once felt intimidating now feel second nature.  An added bonus was the notes, which removed the overhead of excessive note-taking and allowed for more focused learning. The balance between theory and hands-on learning was perfect, making it easy to apply new knowledge in real-world projects. By the end of the course, I feel a significant boost in my confidence—whether at work, workshops, meetups, discussions, projects, or analyzing cutting-edge AI advancements.  This course is truly for everyone, whether you’re getting started or deepening your expertise in Generative AI. Highly recommended!

The curriculum was well-structured, covering everything from basic neural networks to advanced frameworks and architectures.  One of the highlights was the transformer architecture, which was covered in remarkable depth with absolute clarity—no confusion, just a seamless understanding of self-attention, positional encoding, and how these models scale. And the way Keerti delivered it leaves a lasting impact—truly unmatched and unforgettable! Beyond the structured content, they also stretched beyond to cover the absolute latest - DeepSeek.

Concepts that once felt intimidating now feel second nature.  An added bonus was the notes, which removed the overhead of excessive note-taking and allowed for more focused learning. The balance between theory and hands-on learning was perfect, making it easy to apply new knowledge in real-world projects. By the end of the course, I feel a significant boost in my confidence—whether at work, workshops, meetups, discussions, projects, or analyzing cutting-edge AI advancements.  This course is truly for everyone, whether you’re getting started or deepening your expertise in Generative AI. Highly recommended!
